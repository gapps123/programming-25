</text-box>

<p>We have now covered conditional structures in some detail. Another central technique in programming is repetition, or <em>iteration</em>. Together these form the fundamental control structures any programmer must master. They are called control structures because essentially they allow you to control which lines of code get executed when. While conditional structures allow you to <em>choose between</em> sections of code, iteration structures allow you to <em>repeat</em> sections of code. They are often called <em>loops</em> because they allow the program to “loop back” to some line that was already executed before. The process of executing one repetition of a loop is also referred to as an iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>This section introduces a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> loop. Its structure is similar to the conditional statements we already covered. In the next part we will delve into some more sophisticated examples.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at a program which asks the user to type in a number and then prints out the number squared. This continues until the user types in -1.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in a number, -1 to quit: "</span><span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Thanks and bye!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running the program could look like this:</p>

<sample-output>

Please type in a number, -1 to quit: **2**
4
Please type in a number, -1 to quit: **4**
16
Please type in a number, -1 to quit: **10**
100
Please type in a number, -1 to quit: **-1**
Thanks and bye!

</sample-output>

<p>As you can see above, the program asks for several numbers, thanks to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> statement in the program. When the user types in -1, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">break</code> command is executed, which exits the loop and execution continues from the first line after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">while</code> block.</p>

<p>With loops, it is crucial that there is always a way to exit the loop at some point in the code, otherwise the repetition could go on forever. To illustrate this, let’s change the above example a little:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in a number, -1 to quit: "</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Thanks and bye!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this version the program asks the user to type in a number <em>outside the loop</em>. If the user types in any other number than -1, the loop is never exited from. This forms an <em>infinite loop</em>, which means the block of code within the loop is repeated endlessly:</p>

<sample-output>

Please type in a number, -1 to quit: **2**
4
4
4
4
4
4
4
4
(continued ad infinitum...)

</sample-output>

<p>The following program has a similar structure to the example above the infinite loop, but the user experience is quite different. This program allows the user to proceed only if they type in the correct PIN <em>1234</em>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in your PIN: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"1234"</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Incorrect...try again"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Correct PIN entered!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<sample-output>

Please type in your PIN: **0000**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **9999**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **1234**
Correct PIN entered!

</sample-output>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Shall we continue?" tmcname="part02-15_shall_we_continue">

Let's create a program along the lines of the example above. This program should print out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user inputs "no". Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish. Please have a look at the example below.

<sample-output>

hi
Shall we continue? **yes**
hi
Shall we continue? **oui**
hi
Shall we continue? **jawohl**
hi
Shall we continue? **no**
okay then

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Input validation" tmcname="part02-16_input_validation">

Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers.

If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "Invalid number".

If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python `sqrt` function.

In either case, the program should then ask for another number.

If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and exit the loop.

Below you'll find a reminder of how the `sqrt` function is used. Remember to `import` it in the beginning of the program.

```python
# sqrt function will not work without this line in the beginning of the program
from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(9))
```

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Fix the code: Countdown" tmcname="part02-17_countdown">

This program should print out a countdown. The code is as follows:

```python
number = 5
print("Countdown!")
while True:
  print(number)
  number = number - 1

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Repeat password" tmcname="part02-18_repeat_password">

Please write a program which asks the user for a password. The program should then ask the user to type in the password again. If the user types in something else than the first password, the program should keep on asking until the user types the first password again correctly.

Have a look at the expected behaviour below:

<sample-output>

<h2 id="loops-and-helper-variables">Loops and helper variables</h2>

<p>Let’s make the PIN checking example a bit more realistic. This version gives the user only three attempts at typing in a PIN.</p>

<p>The program uses two helper variables. The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attempts</code> keeps track of how many times the user has typed in a PIN. The variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">success</code> is set to either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">False</code> based on whether the user is successful in signing in.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="c1"># this is printed if the code was incorrect AND there have been less than three attempts
</span>    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Incorrect...try again"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Too many attempts..."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<sample-output>

Please type in your PIN: **0000**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **1234**
Correct PIN entered!

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in your PIN: **0000**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **9999**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **4321**
Too many attempts...

</sample-output>

<p>The loop is exited <em>either</em> when the user types the correct PIN <em>or</em> if there have been too many attempts. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement after the loop checks the value of the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">success</code> and prints out a message accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-print-statements-in-loops">Debugging print statements in loops</h2>

<p>Adding loops to programs also adds to the potential sources of bugs. It becomes even more important to master the use of debugging print statements as introduced in the <a href="/part-2/1-programming-terminology">first section of this part</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s have a look at a program almost identical to the previous example, but with one crucial difference:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in your PIN: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"1234"</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Incorrect...try again"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">success</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Correct PIN entered!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Too many attempts..."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version acts strangely when the user types in the correct code on the third attempt:</p>

<sample-output>

Please type in your PIN: **0000**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **9999**
Incorrect...try again
Please type in your PIN: **1234**
Too many attempts...

</sample-output>

<p>So, let’s try and find the cause by adding some strategic debugging print statements inside the loop:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"beginning of the while block:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in your PIN: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"attempts:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">attempts</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"condition1:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"code:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Incorrect...try again"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<sample-output>

beginning of the while block:
Please type in your PIN: **2233**
attempts: 1
condition1: False
code: 2233
condition2: False
Incorrect...try again
beginning of the while block:
Please type in your PIN: **4545**

condition1: False
code: 4545
condition2: False
Incorrect...try again
beginning of the while block:
Please type in your PIN: **1234**
attempts: 3
condition1: True
Too many attempts...

</sample-output>

<p>From the above printouts we can see that during the third iteration of the loop the condition of the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>, and the loop is exited. This iteration never gets to the second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement, which checks whether the code was typed in correctly:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># ....
</span>
    <span class="c1"># this block is executed too early
</span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>

    <span class="c1"># the third iteration never gets this far
</span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"1234"</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The order of conditional statements, or of different branches within a conditional statement, is a common cause for bugs, especially in loops. Debugging print statements are often the simplest way of finding their cause.</p>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="PIN and number of attempts" tmcname="part02-19_pin_and_number_of_attempts">

Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is _4321_. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

<sample-output>

PIN: **3245**
Wrong
PIN: **1234**
Wrong
PIN: **0000**
Wrong
PIN: **4321**
Correct! It took you 4 attempts

</sample-output>

If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

<sample-output>

PIN: **4321**
Correct! It only took you one single attempt!

</sample-output>

</in-browser-programming-exercise>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="The next leap year" tmcname="part02-20_next_leap_year">

Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and prints out the next leap year.

</sample-output>

</in-browser-programming-exercise>

<h2 id="concatenating-strings-with-the--operator">Concatenating strings with the + operator</h2>

<p>The above example with PIN checking used a helper variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attempts</code> to keep track of how many times the user had tried to type in a code:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in your PIN: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The variable is set to zero outside the loop, and each iteration increases its value by one.</p>

<p>A similar idea of incrementation works with string variables as well. The program could, for instance, keep track of all the PIN codes the user typed in:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="n">codes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">""</span>
<span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="n">attempts</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="n">codes</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">", "</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The helper variable is initialized to <em>an empty string</em>, that is, a string with no characters in it:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">codes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With each iteration the string gets longer, as the code the user typed in is added, along with a comma:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in your PIN: "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">codes</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">", "</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the user types in the codes <em>1111 2222 1234</em>, at the end of the program’s execution the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codes</code> would be</p>

<sample-output>

1111, 2222, 1234,

</sample-output>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Story" tmcname="part02-21_story">

### Part 1

Please write a program which keeps asking the user for words. If the user types in `end`, the program should print out the story the words formed, and finish.

<sample-output>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Working with numbers" tmcname="part02-22_working_with_numbers">

### Pre-task

Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers. The program should keep asking for numbers until the user types in zero.

<sample-output>

Please type in integer numbers. Type in 0 to finish.

### Part 1: Count

After reading in the numbers the program should print out how many numbers were typed in. The zero at the end should not be included in the count.

You will need a new variable here to keep track of the numbers typed in.

<sample-output>

... the program asks for numbers
Numbers typed in 4

### Part 2: Sum

The program should also print out the sum of all the numbers typed in. The zero at the end should not be included in the calculation.

The program should now print out the following:

<sample-output>

... the program asks for numbers
Numbers typed in 4
The sum of the numbers is 34

</sample-output>

### Part 3: Mean

The program should also print out the mean of the numbers. The zero at the end should not be included in the calculation. You may assume the user will always type in at least one valid non-zero number.

<sample-output>

... the program asks for numbers
Numbers typed in 4
The sum of the numbers is 34
The mean of the numbers is 8.5
