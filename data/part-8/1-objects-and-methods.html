<p>This is the first part of the Advanced Course in Programming. The material is designed to be used with the Visual Studio Code editor, just like the preceding Introduction to Programming course was. If you havenâ€™t use Visual Studio Code before, you will find the installation instructions <a href="https://www.mooc.fi/en/installation/vscode">here</a>, and an introduction to the programming environment from the previous course <a href="/part-4/1-vscode">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to Programming course we noticed that it often makes sense to group related data together in our programs. For example, if we are trying to store information about a book, it might make sense to use a tuple or a dictionary to organize the data into a single data structure.</p>

<p>The solution could look like this when using a tuple:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"In Search of Lost Typing"</span>
<span class="n">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Marcel Pythons"</span>
<span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1992</span>

<span class="c1"># Combine these in a tuple
</span><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Print the name of the book
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a case like this, the advantage of using a dictionary is that we can use strings instead of indexes as the keys. That is, we can give descriptive names to the items stored in the data structure:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"In Search of Lost Typing"</span>
<span class="n">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Marcel Pythons"</span>
<span class="n">year</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1992</span>

<span class="c1"># Combine these in a dictionary
</span><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"author"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"year"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">year</span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Print the name of the book
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In both cases we are creating a new <em>object</em>. In programming, the term has the specific meaning of an independent whole, in this case containing some bits of data which are somehow related. Being independent means that any changes made to one object will not affect other objects.</p>

<p>If we were to create two structurally identical representations of books, using dictionaries with identical keys, any changes made to one of them would not have any effect on the other:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">book1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"The Old Man and the Pythons"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"author"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Ernest Pythons"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"year"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1952</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">book2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Seven Pythons"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"author"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Aleksis Python"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"year"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1894</span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="n">book1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"A Farewell to ARM Processors"</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">book2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">])</span>

<text-box variant="info" name="Python objects">

You may remember from the Introduction to Programming course that any value in Python is internally handled as an object. This means that the value stored in a variable is a _reference to an object_. The data itself is stored within the object in computer memory. If you assign a value to a new variable with the command `a = 3`, the value stored in the variable is _not_ 3, but a _reference to an object which contains the value 3_.

Most other programming languages (at least those which support object-oriented programming) include some specially defined _primitive data types_. These usually include at least integer numbers, floating point numbers and Boolean truth values. Primitives are processed directly, meaning that they are stored directly in variables, not as references. Python has no such primitives, but working with the basic data types in Python is practically very similar. Objects of these basic data types (such as numbers, Boolean values and strings) are _immutable_, meaning that they cannot be changed in memory. If the value stored in a variable of a basic data type needs to be changed, the entire reference is replaced, but the object itself remains intact in memory.

</text-box>

<h2 id="objects-and-methods">Objects and methods</h2>

<p>The data stored in an object can be accessed through <em>methods</em>. A method is a function which operates on the specific object it is attached to. The way to distinguish methods from other functions is the way in which they are called: first you write the name of the object targeted, followed by a dot, and then the name of the method, with arguments if any. For example, the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">values</code> returns all the values stored in an object of type dictionary, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dict</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># this creates an object of type dictionary with the name book
</span><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"The Old Man and the Pythons"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"author"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"Ernest Pythons"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"year"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1952</span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Print out all the values
# The method call values() is written after the name of the variable
# Remember the dot notation!
</span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Similarly, string methods target the string object which they are called on. Some examples of string methods include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"Imaginary Irene"</span>

<span class="c1"># Print out the number of times the letter I is found
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I"</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># The number of letters I found in another string
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Irreverent Irises in Islington"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"I"</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># The index of the substring Irene
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Irene"</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c1"># This string has no such substring
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"A completely different string"</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Irene"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>String methods return values, but they will not change the contents of a string. As stated above, strings in Python are immutable. This does not apply to all methods, however. Python lists are mutable, so Python list methods may change the contents of the list they are called on:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">my_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c1"># Add a couple of items
</span><span class="n">my_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">my_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_list</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Remove the first item
</span><span class="n">my_list</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_list</span><span class="p">)</span>

<programming-exercise name="The smallest average result" tmcname="part08-01_smallest_average">

Please write a function named `smallest_average(person1: dict, person2: dict, person3: dict)`, which takes three dictionary objects as its arguments.

Each dictionary object contains values mapped to the following keys:

* `"name"`: The name of the contestant
* `"result1"`: the first result of the contestant (an integer between 1 and 10)
* `"result2"`: the second result of the contestant (as above)
* `"result3"`: the third result of the contestant (as above)

The function should calculate the average of the three results for each contestant, and then return the contestant whose average result was the smallest. The return value should be the entire dictionary object containing the contestant's information.

You may assume there will be no ties, i.e. a single contestant will have the smallest average result.

An example of the function in action:

```python
person1 = {"name": "Mary", "result1": 2, "result2": 3, "result3": 3}
person2 = {"name": "Gary", "result1": 5, "result2": 1, "result3": 8}
person3 = {"name": "Larry", "result1": 3, "result2": 1, "result3": 1}

print(smallest_average(person1, person2, person3))
```

<sample-output>

{'name': 'Larry', 'result1': 3, 'result2': 1, 'result3': 1}

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

<programming-exercise name="Row sums" tmcname="part08-02_row_sums ">

In Python, every value stored in a variable is a reference to an object, so any value stored in a list is also a reference to an object. This is also true when modelling a matrix data structure: each value in the top level list is a reference to another list, which in turn contains references to the objects representing the elements of the matrix.

Please write a function named `row_sums(my_matrix: list)`, which takes an integer matrix as its argument.

The function should add a new element on each row in the matrix. This element contains the sum of the other elements on that row. The function does not have a return value. It should modify the parameter matrix in place.

An example of the function in action:

```python
my_matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
row_sums(my_matrix)
print(my_matrix)
```

<sample-output>

[[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 7]]
