<p>Once you have completed the required number of exercises for either of the courses, you may take the relevant course exam at any of the times listed above. Specifically, you must have received at least 25% of the exercise points for each of the seven parts of the course by 8 AM on the morning of the exam.

<p>Submissions are assessed separately for the Introduction to Programming course (parts 1-7) and the Advanced Course in Programming (parts 8-14).</p>

<h2 id="exercise-points">Exercise points</h2>

<p>Each programming exercise and quiz in each part is worth a number of exercise points. You can find a list of all the exercises in a specific part by clicking the “List of exercises in this part” menu on the index page of that part. You can see your current exercise points total by clicking the blue blob in the bottom right corner of any page in the course material. The percentage in the “Total points” section for each part is the critical one for passing the course.</p>

<h2 id="grading-guidelines">Grading guidelines</h2>

<h3 id="grading-scale">Grading scale</h3>

<p>The course is graded on the following scale:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Total points</th>
        <th>Final grade</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>90 % or more</td>
        <td>5 (Excellent)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>80 % or more, less than 90 %</td>
        <td>4 (Very good)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>70 % or more, less than 80 %</td>
        <td>3 (Good)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>60 % or more, less than 70 %</td>
        <td>2 (Satisfactory)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>50 % or more, less than 60 %</td>
        <td>1 (Sufficient)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>less than 50 %</td>
        <td>Fail</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final grade is calculated based on the number of exercise points received during the course (50 % of final grade) and points received in the exam (50 % of final grade). Your exercise points percentage equals <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">([all received exercise points] / [number of exercise points available on course]) * 100</code>. We are working on including this percentage in the visualisation in the bottom right corner of each page.</p>

<p>For example, if your total points percentage for the exercises for the whole course is 42 %, and you receive 79 % of the points in the exam, your final points percentage will be (42 % + 79 %) / 2 = 60.5 %, which equals grade 2 (Satisfactory).</p>

<p>To pass the course you must have received at least 25% of the exercise points for each part on the course, regardless of the above calculation.</p>

<h4 id="exam-points-cutoff">Exam points cutoff</h4>
