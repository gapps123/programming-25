<p>Let’s have a look at a program which asks the user to input a number, and then prints out different messages based on whether the number is negative, positive, or equal to zero:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in a number: "</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is negative"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is positive or zero"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks a bit clumsy and repetitive. We only ever want to execute one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> blocks, because the input will always be either below zero, or zero or above. That is, either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">number &lt; 0</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">number &gt;= 0</code> is true, but never both at the same time. So, the first conditional statement actually contains all we need here. If it is true, the number is negative. If it is false, the number equals zero or is positive.</p>

<p>Instead of creating a whole another conditional statement, as in the example above, it is possible to create another branch of the same conditional statement to cover all cases <em>where the condition was false</em>. This is called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> statement.</p>

<p>The previous example rewritten:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in a number: "</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is negative"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is positive or zero"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When using an if-else construction, one and exactly one of the branches will always be executed. The following picture illustrates the structure:</p>

<p><img src="2_2_1.png" /></p>

<p>NB: there can never be an else branch without an if branch before it. The if-else construction as a whole forms a single <em>conditional statement</em>.</p>

<p>The following example checks whether a number given by the user is even or not. Parity can be checked with the modulo operator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code>, which produces the remainder of an integer division operation. When divided by two, if the remainder is zero, the number is even. Otherwise the number is odd.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in a number: "</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is even"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The number is odd"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<sample-output>

Please type in a number: **5**
The number is odd

</sample-output>

<p>Another example with string comparison:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">correct</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"kittycat"</span>
<span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Please type in the password: "</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">correct</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Welcome"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"No admittance"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With two different inputs this should print out:</p>

<sample-output>

Please type in the password: **kittycat**
Welcome

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in the password: **monkey**
No admittance

</sample-output>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Age of maturity" tmcname="part02-04_age_of_maturity" height="400px">

Please write a program which asks the user for their age. The program should then print out a message based on whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

<sample-output>

How old are you? **12**
You are not of age!

</sample-output>


<sample-output>

How old are you? **32**
You are of age!

</sample-output>

</in-browser-programming-exercise>

<h2 id="alternative-branches-using-the-elif-statement">Alternative branches using the elif statement</h2>

<p>Often there are more than two options the program should account for. For example, the result of a football match could go three ways: home wins, away wins, or there is a tie.</p>

<p>A conditional statement can be added to with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> branch. It is short for the words “else if”, which means the branch will contain an alternative to the original condition. Importantly, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> statement is executed only if none of the preceding branches is executed.</p>

<p><img src="2_2_2.png" /></p>

<p>Let’s have a look at a program which determines the winner of a match:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">goals_home</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Home goals scored: "</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">goals_away</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Away goals scored: "</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">goals_home</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">goals_away</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The home team won!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">goals_away</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">goals_home</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The away team won!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"It's a tie!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This program could print out three different statements given different inputs:</p>

<sample-output>

Home goals scored: **4**
Away goals scored: **2**
The home team won!

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Home goals scored: **0**
Away goals scored: **6**
The away team won!

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Home goals scored: **3**
Away goals scored: **3**
It's a tie!

</sample-output>

<p>In the above example there are three alternative branches, exactly one of which will always be executed. However, there is no limit to the number of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> branches a conditional statement can contain, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> branch is not mandatory.</p>

<p>This is also a valid conditional statement:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Holiday calendar"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"What is the date today? "</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"Dec 26"</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"It's Boxing Day"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"Dec 31"</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"It's Hogmanay"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"Jan 1"</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"It's New Year's Day"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Thanks and bye."</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<sample-output>

Holiday calendar
What is the date today? **Dec 31**
It's Hogmanay
Thanks and bye.

</sample-output>

<p>Notice the previous example has no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">else</code> branch. If the user inputs a date which is not mentioned in any of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> branches, or inputs a date in a different format, none of the three branches of the conditional statement is executed.</p>

<sample-output>

Holiday calendar
What is the date today? **Dec 25**
Thanks and bye.

</sample-output>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Greater than or equal to" tmcname="part02-05_greater_or_equal" height="400px">

Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater. If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

<sample-output>

Please type in the first number: **5**
Please type in another number: **3**
The greater number was: 5

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in the first number: **5**
Please type in another number: **8**
The greater number was: 8

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in the first number: **5**
Please type in another number: **5**
The numbers are equal!

</sample-output>

</in-browser-programming-exercise>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="The elder" tmcname="part02-06_elder" height="550px">

Please write a program which asks for the names and ages of two persons. The program should then print out the name of the elder.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

<sample-output>

Person 1:
Name: **Alan**
Age: **26**
Person 2:
Name: **Ada**
Age: **27**
The elder is Ada

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Person 1:
Name: **Bill**
Age: **1**
Person 2:
Name: **Jean**
Age: **1**
Bill and Jean are the same age

</sample-output>

</in-browser-programming-exercise>

<in-browser-programming-exercise name="Alphabetically last" tmcname="part02-07_alphabetically_last" height="500px">

Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. String `a` is smaller than string `b` if it comes alphabetically before `b`. Notice however that the comparison is only reliable if
- the characters compared are of the same case, i.e. both UPPERCASE or both lowercase
- only the standard English alphabet of a to z, or A to Z, is used.

Please write a program which asks the user for two words. The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last.

You can assume all words will be typed in lowercase entirely.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

<sample-output>

Please type in the 1st word: **car**
Please type in the 2nd word: **scooter**
scooter comes alphabetically last.

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in the 1st word: **zorro**
Please type in the 2nd word: **batman**
zorro comes alphabetically last.

</sample-output>

<sample-output>

Please type in the 1st word: **python**
Please type in the 2nd word: **python**
You gave the same word twice.

</sample-output>
