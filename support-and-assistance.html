<p>Discord is a communication platform which allows both text-based and voice/video chats. You can find out more about the platform <a href="https://discord.com/">on the Discord website</a>.</p>

<p>The course channels are available through <a href="https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/ohjelmoinnin_mooc">this link</a>. See especially the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ohjelmoinnin_mooc_english</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ohjelmoinnin_mooc_voice</code> channels for support in English.</p>

<p>Instructor will be on standby on the course channels in Discord at guidance time. Instructor will also reply to questions sent via private messages. Discord also has a discussion about the course outside of the guidance hours, so it’s worth joining!</p>
